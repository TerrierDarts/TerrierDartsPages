### Grab The Import Code

<CopyButton>
{importCode}
</CopyButton>

### In Streamer.bot
When importing it will ask you if you want to allow '[Heat] Your Id' to run an on import, this is fine to just press yes.

Then it will pop up with your ID. Please copy this ID as we need it.

You should of also imported a Websocket Client, you can find this at `Servers and Clients >> Websocket Clients` you will see the following address `wss://heat-api.j38.net/channel/<YOUR ID>` and just paste the id you've just copied.

This action triggers when a message is recieved and it will trigger the `[Heat] Message` action.

After Importing the code you will have to make sure all the `Execute Code` sub-actions Compile they should but below are a list of refernces you may need if they do not.

```csharp
System.Drawing.dll
System.dll
System.Net.dll
```


`[Heat] OBS Lock Event` should have a OBS Event trigger tied to it, this event will be the `SceneItemLockStateChanged`. The one thing you might need to do is ensure this is correctly pointed to your version of OBS, remembering this only works with Websocket 5



Now the core system of Heat should be installed

### Configuration

Now to get things working, you will need to tell SB the actions/sources you want to be clickable. You will find these in `[Heat] Sources` you will notice from the import that there is a group. You just need to edit and duplicate for all the sources you wish to use. Then you will need to create actions of the **SAME NAME** which will be triggered on clicks. Meaning if you have a source called `Blue` then the action must be called `Blue` like seen below.

![Sources](/buildImages/heat_core/sources.png)

Now heat should have its actions that are triggered.

<Notification type="error">
 <Icon pack="ion" name="information-circle-outline" />
One thing to note is in OBS Source Alignment needs to be "Top Left" other wise the source will be ignored.
</Notification>


In `[Heat] Message` they are a few settings. These will change how heat behaves for you. 

|Arugment|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`obsWebsocketId`| This is if you use more than one OBS i.e Streaming and Recording then you can use this to connect to the streaming one.|
|`allowAnon`| Heat requires the clicker (your viewers) to grant access to there ID's setting this to false will mean users who havent will have there clicks ignored, if its set to true then users who havent granted access will be handled as "someone" instead of their username if you choose to use user names.|
|`realTime`| Setting this to true means that your sources will be updated with each click, rather than with the lock event. This is not reccomented for high click volumes, false will just use the lock event|
|`debugMode`|This is on by default, you will want this off. The purpose of this is to help you follow the logic it is also helpful if you reach out for help in discords however for production you will want it off, but you may want it on just while setting up|

### Additional Information

You can click and press `Ctrl`, `Alt` and/or `Shift` (Will be slightly different for mac users)  [Check here for Info on the modifires](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/getModifierState). You can use the following c# code below to have different actions based on said modifiers.

```csharp
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        bool alt = bool.Parse(args["alt"].ToString());
        bool ctrl = bool.Parse(args["ctrl"].ToString());
        bool shift = bool.Parse(args["shift"].ToString());
        string message;
        int flag = (alt ? 1 : 0) + (ctrl ? 2 : 0) + (shift ? 4 : 0);
        switch (flag)
        {
            case 1: //Just Alt
                message = "Just Alt";
                break;
            case 2: //Just Ctrl
                message = "Just Ctrl";
                break;
            case 4: // Just Shift
                message = "Just Shift";
                break;
            case 3: // Ctrl + Alt
                message = "Ctrl&Alt";
                break;
            case 5: //Alt + Shift
                message = "Alt&Shift";
                break;
            case 6: //Shift + Ctrl
                message = "Ctrl&Shift";
                break;
            case 7: //All3
                message = "ALL 3";
                break;
            default: //None
                message = "None or Error";
                break;
        }

        //CPH.SendMessage(message);
        return true;
    }
}

```

Here you can add something like `CPH.RunAction(string actionName)` under the `message=` to run the actions you want to or you can just code them in. Just note above is an example of how it can be done.

### Special Thanks

Special Thanks to Farlezz for this, the code here would not be possible without you.
