This is a new ranking system, built with the inspiration from VRFlad's original code. However this has an added twist, as once user hit a certian points total they will rank up and there points will be in some ways reset. This is just like earning XP in a game, everything your viewers do will earn XP, chatting, cheering, follows, raids, subs, gifts and so on.

Donations are not yet added but it is the next thing on my list.

This system took a lot of time and effort to build so if you do like it please consider signing up to my patreon https://www.patreon.com/terrierdarts


Please Note, this system is still under testing.

### Grab The Import Code

<CopyButton>
{importCode}
</CopyButton>

<a href="/sb_codes/ranking_system/RankingSystem.dll"><button class="btn"><i class="fa fa-download"></i>Click here to Download the DLL</button></a>
**Warning Since this is a `.dll` it might be treated as dangerous but it is perfectly safe**

Once downloaded add it to you dll folder inside your streamerbot folder, and then when you open streamerbot go to Settings >> C# Compiler and add it there this will make life easier.

### In Streamer.bot

None of the triggers currently correctly so ive left them out. They will be added in the future but atm you will need to add them.


This is the thing i need testing, 

If you already use Flads point system, then you should be able to run the action `[PRS] - Import from Current System` This should create a userRanks.json file inside you streamerbot data folder.


### How to Configure

Here are the methods that can be used with this ranking system.

```csharp
using Ranking.Points;
//Get File Path
string RankingSystem.GetFilePath();  //internal method

//Adding, Getting and Setting Points
void RankingSystem.AddPoints(string user, int points);
void RankingSystem.SetPoints(string user, int points);
int RankingSystem.GetPoints(string user);

//Adding Getting and Setting Rank
void RankingSystem.AddRank(string user, int ranks);
void RankingSystem.SetRank(string user, int ranks);
int RankingSystem.GetRank(string user);

// Check if user has ranked up
bool RankingSystem.RankUpCheck(string user);

// Return Info for Leaderboard
List<string> RankingSystem.FullLeaderboard();

//Get Users
List<string> RankingSystem.UserList();
int RankingSystem.GetUserCount();
int RankingSystem.GetPosition();

// Blocking Users
void RankingSystem.BlockUser(string user);
