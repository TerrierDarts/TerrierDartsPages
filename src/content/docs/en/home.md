## About Me

I am known around most parts as TD, but Terrier or TerrierDarts is just fine. I am a Twitch Streamer and Youtube content creator. I am also an extension developer for [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot). The main content of my Youtube is tutorials and builds of things i have made. I also upload my podcast on there.

If you need any help or advice you can reach out to me in the streamer bot discord or my own personal discord! Links for them can be found below.
