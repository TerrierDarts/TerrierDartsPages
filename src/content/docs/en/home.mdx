Thank you for coming along to my site, here are all the things I have built for you to use on your streams.

Things are here for you, but they wouldn't be here because of help from many people.

Anyone who has provided some source code or helped is added to [Acknowledgements](/en/credits) as I think it is key to share ideas but it's also important to thank and know where the help came from so that's my way of doing that. 

So go ahead and have a browse and see if you find anything you like. While my codes might be in other places this is the only place with all my codes!

# GOALS FOR 2024

Get to 1K Followers on Twitch! >> https://twitch.tv/terrierdarts

Get to 1k Subscribers on YouTube! >> https://youtube.com/@TerrierDarts

So if you haven't I would really apprciate the support, and these are two ways you can do it for FREE. (The same price as my extensions I've built)

### About Me

I am known around most parts as TD, but Terrier or TerrierDarts is just fine.

I am a Twitch Streamer and YouTube content creator. 

I am also an extension and media developer for [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot). 

The main content of my Youtube is tutorials and builds of things I have made.

I also upload my podcast on there.

If you need any help or advice you can reach out to me in the Streamer.Bot discord or my own personal discord! Links for them can be found below.

### Patreons

I wouldnt be able to create the content I do without my Patreons!

If you want to join my Patreon you can here https://www.patreon.com/terrierdarts

I will find a way to add Patreons Here in a Fancy Way but for now.

I Thank you all!
