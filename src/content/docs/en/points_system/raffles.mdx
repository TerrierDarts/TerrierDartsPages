### In Streamer.bot 

Once imported, you will notice like all of my chat games it includes an ***Action*** called `[Currency] - [Set Triggers]`. This ***Action*** will create a `.json` file in your data folder. It will only update when there is an update to be pulled from the site, also note it could create triggers for games or extensions you do not have, this is nothing to worry about.

If you already have this **Action** I would reccommend you choose to replace it as it might change, but I am taking every effort it doesn't change. 

You should then restart Streamer.bot so it can create the ***Triggers*** you need as the ***Triggers*** will create themselves every time you start Streamer.bot. If done correctly you should receieve a ***Toast Notification*** confirming this. 

This import will contain 7 Actions, 2 Command and a Queue.


#### Actions

This game has 3 Admin Actions, These 3 actions will handle all the logic. These should not be edited and you do so at your own risk!

`[Currency Admin] - [Raffle] - Start` this action is how you will start the raffles, In the import its tied to `!raffle` and the way to use it is to do `!raffle <amount>` if you don't provide an amount it will use the default prize, you can also use `k` and `m` for 1000 and 1,000,000. 

`[Currency Admin] - [Raffle] - Join` is how users will join from the import it is set from `!ticket`. 

`[Currency Admin] - [Raffle] - End` this action will trigger automattically when the raffle time is up.


#### Triggers Avaliable

**5** New Triggers can be found under `Custom >> Currency >> Raffle`

|Trigger Name|When Triggered|

|`Join`| Triggered when a user goes all-in and loses.|
|`End (Single Winner)`|Triggered on any win.|
|`End (All Winners)`|Triggered on any Loss.|
|`Failed`|Triggered when a user wins but not an all-in win.|

#### Fail Codes

Fail Codes are a way to explain why something went wrong if something did go wrong, they will be populated from the Fail Trigger, and will be `failCode` and `failReason`. Using these you can create a single currency game fail action if you wish! 

|Code|Reason|
|---:|:---| 
|`1`| `Raffle already active`|
|`2`| `Raffle not active`|
|`3`| `User maximum allowed tickets`|
|`4`| `User can not afford`|
|`5`| `Nobody entered the raffle`| 

### Configuration

Across the 3 actions there are the following settings. 

|Setting|Purpose|
|---:|:---|
|`defaultPrize`| This is the default prize if none is given.|
|`length`| This is how long the raffle will last for|
|`trigger`| This is how users can joing the raffle|
|`raffleCost`| This is a cost for a raffle Ticket, this can be 0|
|`maxEntry`| This is how many entries a person can have, if cost is 0 this will default to 1|
|`multiWinners`| This is if you want more than 1 winner if enough people join|
|`entriesPerWinner`| This controls how many entries we need to get an extra winner|
|`sharePrize`| This is if they will share the prize or will they each get the prize value|
|`defaultPoints`|This is the amount of points a User will be given if they have no points|

Using the arguments listed above the Send Message Sub Actions can be edited to suit your needs. Its also wise to rememeber that `End (Single Winner)` Will Trigger for each winner if you have more than one, and `End (All Winners)` will trigger once listing all the winners.
