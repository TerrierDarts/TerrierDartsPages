import CopyButton from '../CopyButton.astro';
import importCode from '/sb_codes/points_system/raffle.txt?raw';

### Grab the Import Code

<CopyButton>
{importCode}
</CopyButton>

### In Streamer.bot

Once imported you will need to make sure that the commands `!raffle` and `!join` are enabled. These commands can be changed if you wish  this is what they are by default. You will also need to double check the permissions on the command so `!raffle` is mod+ only or however you wish to set it.

Then in order to correctly use this you can do  `<!raffle (Amount to win)>`

Note: For the amount you can us `k` and `m` as short form if you wish, so `30K` or `2m` will work and `30000` or `2000000` isn't needed.
