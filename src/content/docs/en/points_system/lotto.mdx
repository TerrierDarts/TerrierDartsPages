### In OBS

This step is optional if you don't want the overlay or if you wish to build your own overlay

You can add the following Browser source (Width :600 Height: 200)
```
https://terrierdarts.pages.dev/obs_links/ranking_system/lotto/index.html
```
<a href="https://codepen.io/terrierdarts/pen/JjMRRKv" target="_blank">The Codepen *Follow this link to get access to the codepen I used for the Visuals if you wish to make any edits*</a>
In order to install this codepen, you will need to follow the link then press `Export` from the bottom right, then press `Export .Zip`

Then you will need to extract the files to somewhere safe. Inside the folder you will have a `dist` folder inside that they will be a `index` file. Open that and it should open in a web browser. Copy and paste the url and create a browser source with that url.

This pen works over SB Websocket, if you dont use the standard `ws://127.0.0.1:8080` you will need to edit it in the codepen/script.js file

### In Streamer.bot

Once imported, you will notice like all of my chat games it includes an ***Action*** called `[Currency] - [Set Triggers]`. This ***Action*** will create a `.json` file in your data folder. It will only update when there is an update to be pulled from the site, also note it could create triggers for games or extensions you do not have, this is nothing to worry about.

If you already have this **Action** I would reccommend you choose to replace it as it might change, but I am taking every effort it doesn't change. 

You should then restart Streamer.bot so it can create the ***Triggers*** you need as the ***Triggers*** will create themselves every time you start Streamer.bot. If done correctly you should receieve a ***Toast Notification*** confirming this. 

This import will contain 8 Actions, 4 Command and a Queue.

#### Actions

This game has 4 Admin Actions, These 4 actions will handle all the logic. These should not be edited unless noted and you do so at your own risk!

Any imported commands will be disabled by default.

`[Currency Admin] - [Lotto] - Buy Tickets` triggered with the command `!buyticket` is how your viewers will buy tickets they can also follow it with a number to choose how many tickets they want to buy, they can also follow it with `max` this will let the user buy all the tickets that they are able to buy either from the ticket limit or the amount of points this user has.


`[Currency Admin - [Lotto] - Draw` triggered with the command `!draw` will perform a draw of the lotto balls.

`[Currency Admin] - [Lotto] - Check Num of Tickets`  triggered with the command  `!tickets` will allow the users to check how many tickets they have. This action may be edited but not the Execute Code, only the send messages.

`[Currency Admin] - [Lotto] - Clear The Draw`  triggered with the command  `!cleardraw` will clear the current tickets you have, this command should be Mod+

#### Arguments Populated

Each Trigger will populate it's own arguments. These are the arugments that will be populated some may differ in the winning stages I have tried marking these best I can. The gist of it is that anthing that is more user specific is only populated on the Single events, while the broader ones will be on the all. Also note that `%prizeX%` where X is 3,4 and 5 will also be populated. 

|Argument|Description|

|`%amountUserHasAvaliable%`|This is the actual amount the user can buy in relation to points, tickets already bought and maximum tickets allowed.(Buy Tickets)|
|`%amountBought%`|This is the amount of tickets the user has currently bought.(Buy Tickets)|
|`%ticketsString%`|This is a long string of the tickets bought.(Buy Tickets)|
|`%ticketsNewLine%`|This is a string of the tickets bought seperated by a `\n` so when posted to discord it pushes a new line.(Buy Tickets)|
|`%ticketsList%`|This is the tickets bought in `List<string>` form.(Buy Tickets)|
|`%newTicketCount%`|This is the new amount of tickets the user now has.(Buy Tickets)|

|`%winners%`|This is a `List<string>` of the winners (Match X All)|
|`%allWinners%`|This returns a `List<Tuple<string, int>` of the user who won and the number of numbers matched.(Winners All)|

#### Fail Codes

Fail Codes are a way to explain why something went wrong if something did go wrong, they will be populated from the Fail Trigger, and will be `failCode` and `failReason`. Using these you can create a single currency game fail action if you wish! 

|Code|Reason|
|---:|:---| 
|`1`| `User has max Tickets`|
|`2`| `User cant afford any more tickets.`|
|`3`| `User maximum allowed tickets`|
|`4`| `User can not afford`|
|`5`| `Nobody entered the raffle`|
