### In Streamer.bot

Once imported you will need to make sure that the command `!casino` is enabled.

Then in order to correctly use this you can do  `<{trigger} (Amount To Gamble) (What your betting on)>`

Users can bet on Direct Numbers paying x35, Red or Black paying x2 and Odd or Even Also paying x2
