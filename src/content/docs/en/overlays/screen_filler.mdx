### Notes
This works straight from chat messages there is no import code.

#### Commands
`!ball` will add the users PFP 

`!explode` will create an

`!clear` Command for the mod+

`!multiball` add multiples of one emote.

For the Emote fillers they will be auto added (Animated ones do not fully work **yet!**)

#### Url Param(Settings)
There are also some URL Params so you can add these to the end of the Url.

|Param|Value|Purpose|Default|
|---|---|---|---|
|`roof`|`bool`|This Will turn the roof on or off|`false`|
|`timeout`|`int`|This is how long in seconds you want the balls to last on screen, use `null` if you dont want them to timeout|`60`|
|`multion`|`bool`| This is if you want the multi feature on or off|`true`|
|`multidefault`|`int`| This is the amount of balls that will drop if none is given|`25`|
|`explode`|`double`|This controls the explode level, this can be a decimal `0.25` is fairly tame|`1`|
|`permission` ^|`int`| The role of the user that can use `!multiball` 1=`Viewer`, 2=`VIP`, 3=`Moderator`, 4=`Broadcaster`|`1`|
|`subonly` ^|`bool`|This controls if you want it to be subonly, this is alongside the above setting|`false`|

^ This Setting is Twitch Only. 

Url Params go at the end of an URL with a `?` then then a `&` for any extra so for example.

`?roof=false&timeout=60`

So an url would look like this.

```
http://terrierdarts.co.uk/obs_links/fillers/emotes/index.html?roof=false&timeout=60
```
