### OBS Set-Up

Using OBS create a browser source.

Add the dimensions (**Width:500 / Height:650**).

Paste in the Link:
```

```

Tick `Allow OBS to control the audio.`

### Notes

When a first word message comes in the box will move up so you want to place this so that the empty space is seen inside obs but the Notification is not.
