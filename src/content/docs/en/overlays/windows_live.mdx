### OBS Set-Up

Using OBS create a browser source.

Add the dimensions (**Width:500 / Height:650**).

Paste in the Link:
```
http://terrierdarts.co.uk/obs_links/wln_first_words/index.html
```

Tick `Allow OBS to control the audio.`

### Notes

When a first word message comes in the box will move up so you want to place this so that the empty space is seen inside obs but the Notification is not.

If you wish to have this local and you still want the .mp3 file you can download it from here http://terrierdarts.co.uk/obs_links/wln_first_words/messenger-type.mp3 And it to the same folder your index.html file is in.
