### OBS Set-Up

Using OBS create a browser source.

Add the dimensions (**Width:1920 / Height:1080**).

Paste in the Link:

```
https://terrierdarts.co.uk/obs_links/game_change_gameboy/index.html
```

You will then need to crop the source to how you want it to look.

Here is the codepen Version if you need it: https://codepen.io/terrierdarts/pen/eYrobRZ

To Find out how to Import Codepens into OBS Follow this [Guide](/en/codepens).

### Streamer.bot Set-Up

Make sure your websocket is enabled.`ws://127.0.0.1:8080`

<CopyButton>
{importCode}
</CopyButton>

One the code is imported, you will need to make sure the 2 OBS Sub-Actions are pointed towards the Browser Source youve just created.

Add This action to the "Stream Update" Event, so it will trigger when the game changes, this trigger should be imported also.
