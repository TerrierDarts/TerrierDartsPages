<b>This extension is based of the fantastic work done initially by [VRFlad](www.twitch.tv/VRFlad) so huge thank you to him for giving me a great base to work with.</b>

### Get The Overlay

You can get the original pen from here if you wish to make any edits.
[Here is My Codepen](https://codepen.io/terrierdarts/pen/jOppbZy?editors=0110)

Or you can just add,

```
https://terrierdarts.co.uk/obs_links/multi_death_counter/index.html
```

as a browser source in obs if you are happy with how it looks.
> Just note if you don't use 127.0.0.1:8080 then you will need to grab the code pen version

When adding this as a browser source, please set it as `Width:450` and `Height:700`

All the commands you will need are Imported however you will need to ensure they are enabled (Streamer.bot disables them by default for security). You will also need make sure the correct commands are Mod and Broadcaster Only.
Commands Imported

```
!death-
!death+
!deaths
!logDeaths
!resetAllDeaths
