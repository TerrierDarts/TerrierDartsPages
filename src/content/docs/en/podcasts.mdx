## What is the Podcast?

The Podcast is a fortnightly (excluing breaks) podcast where I sit down with a wonderful guest and discuss all things streamer.bot. We also get an insight into the type of streamer, person and user they are. It has a been a pleasure to interview all the guests what have been on and I would love to thank them for their time. 

## What sort of questions do you ask?

We ask an array of questions most fly off into bizzare and random tangets, but it mainly falls  under the scope of, How they started streaming, How they found streamerbot, what they have built in the bot and what other people have built in the bot and we always try finish off with things they want adding or fixing into the bot.
