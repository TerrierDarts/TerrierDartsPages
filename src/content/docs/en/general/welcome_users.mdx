import CopyButton from '../CopyButton.astro'
import importCode from '/sb_codes/general/welcome_users.txt?raw';

### Grab The Import Code


<CopyButton>
{importCode}
</CopyButton>


### In Streamer.bot

Once the code is imported you will notice it already has the `Twitch First Words` Trigger on, however you can easily swap this for the YouTube Version if you so wish.

### Configure

In order to add a new user all you need to do is create an Action called `[FW]-` followed by there name. So if you wanted to create one for me the action would be called `[FW]-TerrierDarts`.

In the main action you imported there is also a part at the bottom where you can add the parts of the default action so things can run if a non-custom user walks in.
