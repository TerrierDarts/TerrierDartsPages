### In Streamer.bot

This action will create a folder and file inside the data folder of streamerbot, aslong as your streamerbot isnt in the program folder where it might run into 
 
#### Actions 

The action `[Tip Converter] Save File` will run each time you start streamer.bot, my recommendation here is to set the `%myCurrencyCode%` to your currency code `usd`, `gbp`, `eur` to name some of the more popular ones. Once that is set restart streamerbot. If you dont wish to restart you can just run a test on the Trigger this will create the initial folders and files it needs to.
