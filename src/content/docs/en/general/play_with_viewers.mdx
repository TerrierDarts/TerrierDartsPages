## Streamer.bot Set-Up

<CopyButton>{importCode}</CopyButton>

Once imported you will notice it contains 12 `Actions` and 17 `Commands`, these `commands` will need to be enabled in order to work. The next thing you will need to do is either restart Streamer.bot or trigger the `Test` on the `[Queue Admin] Set Triggers`.

It is advised to not edit either of the 3 `[Queue Admin]` actions and  doing do you do at your own risk. This code uses custom Triggers so if you dont see this in the triggers part of Streamer.bot its likely you haven't done it correctly, and my suggestion here would be to restart Streamer.bot again. If you've restarted Streamer.bot and you still can't see these triggers reach out in discord. (Link for my Personal one is at the bottom of the page, but either the Official Streamerbot one or the Extentions one )

Also everytime Streamer.bot loads up it will notify you that these queue triggers have added, you can stop this by disabling the 'Show Toast Notification' Sub-Action in the `[Queue Admin] Set Triggers` Action, the notification will look like this.

![toast](/buildImages/queue_system/queue_toast.png)

This code will also create a `.txt` file, I've included a stand alone action called `[Queue Admin] Open Queue File` which will open the file in your default `.txt` program. For referance the file will be kept inside `%STREAMER_BOT_FOLDER%/data/json/playWithViwers.txt`

You will also need to double check the permissons on the commands. I've added a `(M)` and a `(B)` on some of the commands to prompt a suggestion for a Mod or Broadcaster Command. Please dont delete and re-add commands if you wish to edit them you can do so in the current commands edit dailog box.  


## Configuration

This code should work on both Twitch and YouTube. However its currently set to work on with Twitch.

Every command is set to trigger the `[Queue Admin] Code` Action and depending on what command is triggered and if its triggered correctly the code will broadcast one of the following 29 Custom Triggers.

```
Start
Close
Open 
Clear
Join - Success or Failed
Pull  - Success or Failed
Random Pull - Success or Failed
Peak  - Success or Failed
Shuffle - Success or Failed
Mod Remove  - Success or Failed
Leave  - Success or Failed
Position - Target, Self or Failed
Skip Peak  - Success or Failed
Skip Pull  - Success or Failed
Jump  - Success or Failed
Full Queue  - Success or Failed
```

7 of imported actions are triggered by the above Custom Triggers, they will return different arguments for you to use when trying to build your actions you wish to have. Doing it this way not only allows for cross platform but also allow a greater freedom in what happens when people are pulled or join for example. Please note Certain commands may not work as well as expected on YouTube this is due to issues/limitions with YouTube. 

<Notification type="info">
 <Icon pack="ion" name="information-circle-outline" />
Until I can get a full testing and feedback on YouTube I'm not sure what needs changing.
</Notification>

Included is are 2 examples, 1 is how you can trigger this with a channel point and 1 how you can use your currency system if you have one. Hopefully the examples are clear enough but few things to remember: 
1) Remove the Command Trigger from `[Queue Admin] Code`
2) Make sure you choose the Method you want to use not and not just `Execute`

Again Actions can be built however you want you can add SFX or onscreen assets.
